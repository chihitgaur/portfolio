         A passionate and performance-driven AI & Automation Engineer with over 2 years of experience blending intelligent automation with cutting-edge AI technologies. With a background in Information Technology and a deep love for solving complex problems, I specialize in transforming manual processes into smart, efficient, and scalable systems—driven by a mix of logic, creativity, and innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg">
        I began my career as a DevOps Engineer, where I gained hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud-based deployments using tools like Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. As I became more involved in optimizing operational workflows, my interest naturally transitioned into Robotic Process Automation (RPA). I quickly excelled with platforms like Power Automate, UiPath, and Selenium, building automation solutions that reduced manual efforts and streamlined critical healthcare and enterprise processes. Driven by a passion for innovation, I then expanded into the world of Generative AI, developing advanced solutions using GPT-4o, Whisper, LangChain, and fine-tuned LLMs—automating everything from denial management and document parsing to real-time audio transcription and chatbot deployment.
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg">
        Currently, I’m building and deploying AI-first automation systems that harness the power of large language models, Azure AI, and containerized DevOps pipelines via Kubernetes and Docker. My approach blends technical sharpness with a user-first mindset, and I’ve been recognized with multiple awards—including Best Performer and Innovator Award—for delivering impactful, production-grade solutions.        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg">
            I take pride in continuously learning and pushing boundaries, whether it’s through developing scalable backend architectures, integrating OCR and NLP for document intelligence, or ensuring secure deployments with Azure Key Vault. At my core, I’m driven by curiosity, efficiency, and the vision to build systems that think and work like humans—only faster, smarter, and better., <a href="{% url 'contact' %}" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">I'm always eager to collaborate!</a>
